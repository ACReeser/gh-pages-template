<h1>about</h1>
<p>I live in Louisiana and attended LSU for my undergrad CS degree. I'm an avid gamer, my favorite games include the Civilzation series, XCOM, anything by Valve, Minecraft, Borderlands, and a whole bunch more. I'm also a tabletop gamer, and like to tinker with my homebrew setting.</p>
