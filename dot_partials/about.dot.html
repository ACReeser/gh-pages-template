<h1>about</h1>
<p>Hello there! My name is Alex Reeser, and this is my personal website.</p>
<h2>me</h2>
<p>I live in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, work for Cyrious Software, and I spend a lot of time on side-projects. I attended Louisiana State University here in Baton Rouge, and graduated with a Bachelor's in Computer Science.</p>
<p>I'm an avid gamer, and some of my favorite games include the Civilzation series, XCOM, anything by Valve, Minecraft, Borderlands, and a whole bunch more. I'm also a big fan of tabletop games, from D&D to Pandemic, and like to tinker with my own fantasy setting: Springtheory.</p>
<h2>this website</h2>
<p>My digital abode is a single-page-app (driven by Javascript) and a static site that doesn't require Javascript! All pages are built so that if JS is turned off, navigation still works.</p>
<p>This is accomplished by custom-written Javascript on the client, and using a slightly modified static site generator named Zetzer.</p>
<p>This is the second design of alexreeser.me, with a deeper commitment to responsiveness and page transitions. All of the hexagon graphics are custom-made by me, usually in Adobe Illustrator.</p>
<h2>contact</h2>
<p>If you want to contact me, email is the fastest way to get in touch. (I'm no Twitter junkie, so your DM's might go unnoticed for a long time!)</p>
